            <div><h2>My future goals</h2>
            My main goal is to study Mechatronics Engineering which involves the design and analysis of mechanical systems, such as sensors, actuators, and mechanical structures. This can include anything from robotic arms and automated machinery to consumer products like cameras with auto-focus mechanisms. I would therefore acquaint myself with wholesome knowledge in the specified branch of Engineering.  </div>

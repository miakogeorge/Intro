                [Verse 1: Workrate]
                My man raps 'bout two in a day
                Like, no one ain't  did that, big facts
                I was sixteen, that's two in a day
                When I flick that, ying dat, ying dat
                Then I went on and done five in a week
                <br>
                Done numerous drills and I made it back
                'Cah all I know is to get on my knees
                And I pray to Allah and I gave him thanks (Alhamdulillah)
                <br>
                Bro bro's nine double M just jam
                So watch my spin ting just spin then bang (Baow)
                It's life we're risking, anytime we bang
                Do it for the cause, 'cah I love my batch
                <br>
                Teerose just got slapped in dank
                And right now I'm billin' up Shak
                Throwin' up 6 'til they throwin' up L-s (Gang, gang, gang)
                Teerose and Shak, bill them packs
                <br>
                [Verse 2: NitoNB]
                They say we ain't got no chill
                'Cah their bro got killed and we still won't lеave it (Bap, bap)
                In and out blocks with a bruck-back, beat it
                If I spot me an opp, I'mma jump out squeezе it (Grra)
                Bro said "Squeeze it, fill it up, clean it"
                <br>
                Give it a bleaching, drilling completed
                Sinning repeated, don't do pleadin'
                Never did leave it, back it and beat it
                They're upset their friend's on tops (Haha)
                Because they got plugged in with Fumez
                <br>
                So they took us down by the PC plod (Fuck 'em)
                But we still won't stop 'cause it stays un-cocked
                Weren't too shocked when a nigga got dropped
                And the Pyrex pot, said it done man lots
                Who's on what? Red light, don't stop
                Cause the mash in the ride stays way too hot

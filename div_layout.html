            <div style="height: 440px;"> <div class="lside"><p>There are seven Universal Laws or Principles by which everyone and everything in the Universe is governed. To name them, they are the Laws of Mentalism, Correspondence, Vibration, Polarity, Rhythm, Cause and Effect and Gender. The Universe exists in perfect harmony and order by virtue of these Laws. Ancient mystical, esoteric and secret teachings dating back more than 5,000 years from Ancient Egypt to Ancient Greece, all have as a common thread these seven Hermetic Laws of the Universe. Once you understand, apply and align yourself with these seven Universal Laws, you will experience transformation in every area of your life beyond what you have ever dared to imagine. The governing Laws seek neither to punish nor reward you. They are impersonal, operating automatically along unconscious lines without your conscious participation. </p><img src="ultra-detailed-nebula-abstract-wallpaper-4_1562-749.avif" height="270px" width="600px"></div>

            <div class="rside"><p>Of the seven Universal Laws, the first three are the Higher Immutable Laws, meaning that they are Absolute and eternal. They can never be changed or transcended. They have always existed and will always exist. The remaining four of the seven Universal Laws are the Lower Mutable Laws, meaning they are transitory and can be transcended, or else worked with to create an ideal inner and outer world. This is not to say that you should ignore the four Mutable Laws or attempt to defy them because even if you do they will still govern your existence.

                Your aim is to understand each of the seven Universal Laws and then learn to transcend or master the Lower ones through your knowledge and understanding of the Higher Laws.</p></div>
                <div class="rside4"><p>"The Principles of Truth are Seven; he who knows these, understandingly, possesses the Magic Key before whose touch all the Doors of the Temple fly open... He who grasps the truth of the Mental Nature of the Universe is well advanced on The Path to Mastery."—The Kybalion

                    "What are the sciences but maps of universal laws, and universal laws but the channels of universal power; and universal power but the outgoings of a universal mind?"—Edward Thomson
                    
                    “The mind has a definite way of clothing one's thoughts in appropriate physical equivalents. Think in terms of poverty and you will live in poverty. Think in terms of opulence and you will attract opulence. Through the eternal law of harmonious attraction, one's thoughts always clothe themselves in material things appropriate unto their nature.”—Napolean Hill</p></div>
                    <div class="lside2"><p>Understanding emotions is key to directing your emotional world rather than being at its mercy. Human beings are emotional beings. This means your emotions are part of your mental make-up and you are likely to have already felt most emotions at varying degrees—the 'good', the 'bad' and the 'ugly'. Becoming the director of your inner world does not mean you will only have 'feel-good' emotions. Your goal is to understand your emotions so as to calm your 'emotional sea' rather than struggling to stay afloat during a 'storm', and in time to rise above it.</p></div>
                    <div class="rside3"><p>Your negative beliefs are the reason you may find yourself attracting more of the circumstances you do not want in your life, despite your best efforts to focus on what you want. By pitting your conscious mind against your deeply ingrained, subconscious limiting beliefs, you are inadvertently setting yourself up to attract more of the same unwanted circumstances that you are trying to change. To understand why this happens and how to bypass such negative beliefs when consciously creating your reality, you must first understand how the Universal Laws of Attraction, Vibration and Polarity create your circumstances in accordance with your beliefs.</p></div>
                    <div class="rside2"><p>So just what is the Law of Attraction? According to this great Universal Law, you attract into your life those things, circumstances and conditions that correspond with the nature of your dominant thoughts, beliefs and feelings, both conscious and subconscious. Every area of your life, including your health, finances, relationships and so on, are influenced by this Law that "like attracts like". Eugene Fersen, in The Science of Being, referred to the Law of Attraction as "the Basic Law of the Universe". In this article, you will gain the most complete understanding of not only what the Law of Attraction is but also how it works.</p></div>

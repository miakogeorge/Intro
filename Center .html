        <p>It is worth noting that any paragraph written <br> using HTML is aligned on the right hand side of the page<br> by default</p>
        <center></p>However, using center tag as in this paragraph, the alignment<br>is at the center of the page. This makes it appear better arranged<br>giving room for inclusion of other styling elements.</P></center>
